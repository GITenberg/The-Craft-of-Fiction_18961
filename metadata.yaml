description: Critical writing could scarcely be more admirable than this, pronounced
  the New York Times in its review of this 1921 classic of literary criticism. This
  immensely influential text examines such authors as Tolstoy, Flaubert, Thackeray,
  and James, with an eye toward the form rather than the content of storytelling.
